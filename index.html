                Native Americans played many different roles in the American Revolution and faced difficult decisions on which side to support during the war. While some nations chose to align themselves with the British or Americans early in the war, many attempted to stay neutral. However, as the war progressed, and more Americans continued pushing westward more nations began to align themselves with the British. It is important to note that each individual tribe ultimately made their own decisions on who to support or whether to stay neutral. In the end, any stance made during the Revolutionary war did little to protect any of these nationsâ€™ lands.
