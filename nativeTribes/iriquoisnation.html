                The Iroquois Nation, also known as the 6 nations, were a group of Native American nations: the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora. 
On July 13, 1775, according to the Journals of Congress, the Continental Congress drafted a speech to the Six Nations explaining the history between the British and the American colonists and asking for the Iroquois to stay neutral while the colonists and British worked out their grievances. In this speech, the continental congress asks for, “Nothing but peace,” and extends an invitation for to “converse further with us at Albany, where we intend to re-kindle the council fire, which your and our ancestors sat around in great friendship.”
On July 25, 1775, two Oneida men met with members of the Albany Committee of Correspondence to dispel a report that the five Nations were not coming down to cut off the inhabitants of the German flats (Albany Committee of Correspondence Pg 168). 
On August 23, 1775, Seaghnagerat, an Onieda Chief, spoke on behalf of the 6 nations after a council with the 6 nations had occurred. Seaghnagerat discussed the need for peace between the two nations.
However, as tensions rose between the Americans and British throughout 1776-1777 fractures between the members of the 6 nations grew intense and ultimately led to a split with the Oneida and Tuscarora opting to side with the American revolutionaries, while the Mohawk, Seneca, Cayuga, and Onondaga sided with the British. 
This fracture stemmed from relationships of two different individuals: Joseph Brant, also known as Thayendanegea, a prominent Mohawk leader who was very close with Guy Johnson, the British Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the northern colonies and Samuel Kirkland a Presbyterian missionary who became close with the Oneidas. 
At the end of the war, the treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1784 negotiated peace for the 6 nations. This peace treaty treated the Mohawks, Onondagas, Senecas, and Cayugas as defeated enemies, while elevating the Oneida and Tuscarora nations as victors and their land taken back into their possession. This treaty also established new boundaries for the 6 nations which can be seen on the map below. These new boundaries effectively cut the Iroquois nations’ land in half, taking most of the westward land from the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix. (Indian Affairs)
Another treaty was drafted and signed on December 2, 1794, with the Oneida, Tuscarora, and Stockbridge Indians. This treaty’s purpose was to compensate these “faithful friends” for their losses from the war. Compensation was given in the form of payment to individuals of these nations, a gristmill and saw-mill erected, and “a thousand dollars to be applied in building a convenient church at Oneida.” (Indian Affairs)
The Oneida and Tuscarora were the only major Native American nations to formally side with the Americans in the revolution and were treated far better than many of the Native American nations in the middle and southern United States. The treaty signed in 1784 and 1794 were both honored by the United States at the federal level. However, subsequent treaties with the state of New York ultimately resulted in the Oneidas losing almost all the land established by the treaties of 1784 and 1794.
