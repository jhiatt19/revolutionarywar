                The Miami Confederacy formed after the Revolutionary war to push back against encroaching American settlers. This confederacy was made up of Delaware, Miami, Shawnee, Potawatomi, Wyandot, Ottawa, Chippewa, Wea, Piankeshaw, and many smaller Native American nations. This confederacy waged war with the United States from 1785-1795 in the Northwest Indian War. 
Interestingly, both the Delaware and the Shawnee attempted to stay neutral or side with the Americans during the revolution; however, both ended up siding with the British as the war progressed. 
The Delaware initially signed the first Native American treaty with the United States in 1778 in which “peace and friendship shall henceforth take place.” This treaty ultimately fell apart as the Americans didn’t follow through on their promises of building a fort in Delaware land and fulfilling trading agreements.
The Shawnee ended up siding with the British after some of their Chiefs, including Chief Cornstalk, were killed in “cold Blood” by American militiamen at Fort Randolph in 1777. 
At the conclusion of the Revolutionary War, many of these nations did not have the opportunity to discuss a treaty with the United States. The 6 nations attempted to negotiate a treaty on behalf of the western nations as well as for themselves, but the American delegation stated that they were only there to discuss a treaty with the 6 nations. 
Thus, with no treaty to protect their lands and more Americans moving westward and settling on their lands, war broke out in 1785 and lasted until 1795 which led to the Treaty of Greenville. This treaty resulted in the loss of a huge tract of land in the Ohio valley. 
The Miami confederacy shows that staying neutral during the Revolutionary war did not mean you could stay neutral forever and resulted in being left out of establishing relations with the new government. Each of these nations ended up being forced into a fight with the United States because they stayed neutral and then lost their land anyways. Had these nations known that they would have been fighting with the Americans almost immediately after the revolutionary war, they might have sided with the British rather than staying neutral.
